# 1v1 MCQ Battle

A full-stack real-time 1v1 quiz platform built with Django and React. It features room-based matchmaking, real-time gameplay using Pusher, and dynamic MCQ generation via Gemini API. Users can join rooms using unique IDs, compete head-to-head, and view side-by-side final score comparisons. The backend uses JWT authentication and PostgreSQL with custom user and room models, and auto-cleans finished game data to maintain a lightweight database.
